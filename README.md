# GCP Cloud Functions driven by Schedule and Audit Events

This project aims to provide generic schedule and audit event driven Cloud Functions.

Functionality currently covers:

- Labeling GCE instances on creation
- Hardening the Compute Default account (revoking `role/editor`)
- Start and Stop GCE instances based on Asset Search

More hopefully coming soon.

Additionally, we aim at decent support for the larger product lifecyle with an emphasis on a DevOps experience including short cycle times. We leverage Cloud Foundation Toolkit, Cloud Functions Framework, GitHub Actions and Terraform. We cover unit- and integration testing. We stripped dependencies where reasonable and extended where we wanted to go further or connected the dots.

The v1 versions leverage PubSub Log Sinks, ðŸ§ª v2 ðŸ¥¼ is based on EventArc/CloudEvents.

## Usage
Sample Cloud Function and VM deployments designed to play together are provided in the `examples` folder. Unless explicitly disabled, they are also used by the integration tests.

You may want to
```shell
export GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=your-sa@your-prj-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
to get proper access when trying them out.

### Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <a name="output_excludes"></a> [excludes](#output\_excludes) | Files we want to exlude |
| <a name="output_path"></a> [path](#output\_path) | The path to the function source |
| <a name="output_runtime"></a> [runtime](#output\_runtime) | The runtime |
| <a name="output_v1_entry_point"></a> [v1\_entry\_point](#output\_v1\_entry\_point) | The v1 function entry point |
| <a name="output_v2_entry_point"></a> [v2\_entry\_point](#output\_v2\_entry\_point) | The v2 function entry point |

## Development
There are various `Makefile` targets providing entrypoints for CI and steps you might want to do during development.

Cloud Function implementations are currently Go based and we use [Functions Framework for Go](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/functions-framework-go) during development.

Start local service
```shell
# export FUNCTION_TARGET=LabelPubSub # Not needed atm
# export GCP_HOUSEKEEPER_READ_ONLY=1 # If you want read only access to GCP 
export GCP_HOUSEKEEPER_FUNCTION=StartPubSub # Framework workaround atm
make serve
```

Send PubSub payload to local Label Function
```shell
message=test/audit-compute-instance-create.json
endpoint=http://localhost:8080 # Issue with framework : Only one endpoint per process

cat <<EOF | curl -d @- -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "${endpoint}" 
{
  "data": "$(base64 -w 0 $message)",
  "messageId": "3756413890745862",
  "publishTime": "2022-01-03T10:26:11.735Z"
}
EOF
```

Send CloudEvent payload to local Label Function
```shell
message=test/audit-compute-instance-create.json
endpoint=http://localhost:8080
cat <<EOF | curl -d @- -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/cloudevents+json" "${endpoint}" \
{
	"specversion" : "1.0",
	"type" : "example.com.cloud.event",
	"source" : "https://example.com/cloudevents/pull",
	"subject" : "123",
	"id" : "A234-1234-1234",
	"time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
	"data" : $(cat $message)
}
EOF
```

Send PubSub payload to Cloud Function via Topic.

```shell
PROJECT_ID=your-prj-id
function=$(gcloud --project ${PROJECT_ID} functions list | grep ^audit-label | cut -d " " -f 1)
gcloud --project ${PROJECT_ID} functions call ${function} --data='{"message": "Hello World!"}'
gcloud --project ${PROJECT_ID} pubsub topics audit-label --message '{ "fix": "me" }'
```

Read Audit Logs from StackDriver
```shell
gcloud logging read 'protoPayload.@type="type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.audit.AuditLog"' --freshness=1h --project ${PROJECT_ID} --format json
```

Send PubSub payload to local Start/Stop Function
```shell
endpoint=http://localhost:8080
scope=organizations/your-org-id

echo '{"data": "'$(echo '
{
    "scope": "'$scope'",
    "query": "labels.start_daily:true AND state:TERMINATED",
    "assetTypes": ["compute.googleapis.com/Instance"]
}' | base64 -w 0)'"}' | curl -d @- -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "${endpoint}"

echo '{"data": "'$(echo '
{
    "scope": "'$scope'",
    "query": "labels.stop_daily:true AND state:RUNNING",
    "assetTypes": ["compute.googleapis.com/Instance"]
}' | base64 -w 0)'"}' | curl -d @- -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" "${endpoint}"

```

There is a generic `main` entrypoint for the Go implementations which allows one to call functionality straight from the command line. Try
```shell
cd fn
go run main/main.go --help
```
to see what is available.
